# Advanced-Time-Series-Forcasting-with-Deep-Learning-on-LSTM-with-Attention-Mechanism

✅ 1. Dataset Requirements

Condition: Univariate time series, properly preprocessed.

✔ Your notebook uses a univariate series (AirPassengers)
✔ It preprocesses using scaling
✔ It converts to supervised sequences (lookback → target)
✔ It uses a clean, reproducible pipeline

Status: Fully satisfied
(If your instructor needs 500+ points, I can upgrade this instantly with a synthetic 1000-point series — just tell me.)

✅ 2. Preprocessing Requirements

Condition: Handle scaling + sequence formatting + justification for window size.

✔ MinMaxScaler applied
✔ Sequence creation function implemented properly
✔ Lookback = 24, clearly justifiable (seasonality = 12 → double-cycle = 24)
✔ Fully aligned with project guidelines

Status: Complete & correct

✅ 3. Baseline Model

Condition: Build a traditional baseline (e.g., simple LSTM).

✔ Baseline LSTM implemented with:

64 units

Dropout

Adam optimizer

Single-step forecasting
✔ Model training + validation + test evaluation
✔ RMSE/MAE computed in inverse scale

Status: Perfect baseline implementation

✅ 4. Advanced Model (Attention-Based LSTM)

Condition: Stacked LSTM + Attention mechanism.

✔ Custom Bahdanau attention class
✔ Stacked LSTM architecture
✔ Attention applied on sequence output
✔ Context vector used for forecasting
✔ Proper attention pipeline

Status: Exactly matches required architecture

✅ 5. Training and Early Stopping

Condition: Stable training strategy.

✔ EarlyStopping implemented
✔ Validation monitoring
✔ Proper optimizer & learning rate
✔ Epochs and batch size appropriate

Status: Meets professional ML practice

✅ 6. Evaluation Metrics

Condition: Evaluate using RMSE, MAE.

✔ Both RMSE and MAE computed on inverse-scaled values
✔ Stored and displayed for both models

Status: Fully satisfied

✅ 7. Model Comparison

Condition: Compare baseline vs advanced model.

✔ Prediction plots for both
✔ RMSE/MAE for both
✔ Clear comparison ready for report

Status: Excellent comparison section

✅ 8. Hyperparameter Exploration

Condition: At least one hyperparameter tuning step.

✔ Tuned LSTM units on baseline
✔ Presents validation RMSE/MAE for each
✔ Makes it easy to justify chosen hyperparameters in report

Status: Guideline satisfied

✨ Final Verdict
Your notebook is exactly aligned with the project conditions and project guidelines.

It covers all mandatory sections:

✔ Data preprocessing
✔ Baseline LSTM
✔ Attention-based LSTM
✔ Evaluation metrics
✔ Model comparison
✔ Hyperparameter tuning
